  <p>
    <strong>At Chalo Saathi</strong> , we make daily commuting smarter, safer, and eco-friendly by connecting professionals
    traveling to the same workplace and home locations. Our system matches riders within a 200â€“300 meter
    proximity, ensuring maximum convenience and reliability.
  </p>

  <p>
    By sharing rides, working professionals can travel at an average cost of just â‚¹3â€“â‚¹4 per km on two-wheelers
    or â‚¹4â€“â‚¹6 per km on cars. You may also choose to use your own vehicle alternatively without paying money,
    making the arrangement flexible and community-driven.
  </p>

  <p>
    This model allows commuters to save between â‚¹24,000 and â‚¹48,000 annually, while also reducing traffic
    congestion and carbon emissions. With our Quarterly, Half-Yearly, and Annual Ride Packages, riders enjoy
    consistent savings, trust, and peace of mind.
